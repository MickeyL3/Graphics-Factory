Graphics Factory â€“ Developing an OpenGL program to display an industrial factory featuring animated machinery items. 
The scene is set in an industrial factory featuring animated machinery and production items. A conveyor belt runs through the factory, with a hammer acting as a molding machine that transforms raw, cube-shaped materials into teacups. Two large poles serve as storage units for items entering and exiting the conveyor. A dynamic spotlight is mounted on the right pole, while smoke particles emerge from a chimney attached to the hammer arm. On the side, there are two red spinning spheres and a yellow spinning fan.

Planar shadows cast by conveyor belt, cubes and teacups, and yellow spinning fan. 2. A moving conveyor with modelled notches that move in sync with the belt.

A sky sphere textured with a factory themed image.

A dynamic spotlight attached to a spinning object with a visible red color.

A custom-built sweep surface constructed using quad strip, used to model the chimney on the molding arm.

A surface shape generated using mathematical formula, representing the yellow spinning fan 7. Particle system: smoke particles with controlled on and off timing.
